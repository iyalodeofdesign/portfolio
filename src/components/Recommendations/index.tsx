                        This was one of the most positive experiences I've had
                        with anyone on Upwork. Opeyemi was professional, polite,
                        downright pleasant, and an absolute SUPERHERO in Figma.
                        But what made this so exceptional was getting the
                        opportunity to learn from Opeyemi about how the Figma
                        file works and her super clear and knowledgeable
                        communication. Not only was the design exactly what my
                        client requested and created faster than I thought
                        possible, she was able to me all sorts of details about
                        the way the file was set up with best practices in mind.
